This is a precursor to [cafe-grader](http://code.google.com/p/cafe-grader/).  This project is not under active development any more.  This google code site and the repository are mainly for maintenance.  If you are interested in programming contest system, I suggest the new [cafe-grader](http://code.google.com/p/cafe-grader/).

Fossil-grader was used first in the national programming competition in 2005 when Turbo C was the official compiler.  (Right! the one running in DOS mode.)

The web application is written in PHP, while the graders are written in C.  There are two versions of graders: one for Windows and another for Linux (currently not available; I can't find it right now).

See HowToInstall to get started.  To add users and problems, see HowToConfig.
